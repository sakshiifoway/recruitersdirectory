            <ul>
                <li><span>Check your email for a message from TopJobHunting.com</span></li>
                <li><span>If you don't see the email in about 10 minutes, check your spam filter, or if using Gmail, check your Gmail "Promotions" Tab / Folder and move our email to the Primary tab. Once you do that, you'll receive the good stuff, like the MOST WANTED TOP 200 Job Boards list immediately!</span></li>
                <li><span>Optional - you can also add <a href="mailto:team1@topjobhunting.com">team1@topjobhunting.com</a> to your list of "safe senders" in your email program. Otherwise, the content you want may end up in a nasty spam filter. And that's just wrong!</span></li>
